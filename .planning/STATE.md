# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-07)

**Core value:** On-device capture quality is non-negotiable — every uploaded segment must hit the locked spec (1080p / 30 FPS / ≥110° dFOV / IMU sustained ≥100 Hz / ±1 ms timestamp alignment) or the bytes are worthless for training.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation, Backend & Distribution Recon

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Foundation, Backend & Distribution Recon) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Codename "Homelander"; product brand "Humyn Labs Capture"
- Init: Backend included in MVP scope (Fastify + Postgres + S3) — hash-verify and presigned URLs are core to upload reliability
- Init: Designs LOCKED to `prototype.html` + `design-spec.md` + `engineering-handoff.md` — no new design work
- Init: Hand-detection gate (one-shot pre-record) moved into MVP, supersedes deferred entry
- Init: Server-side IMU liveness fraud check **promoted from v2 to MVP** backend scope (Phase 5) — capture spec already collects the data; on-device hand-gate alone is trivially defeated by TV-replay
- Roadmap: Horizontal-layer phase structure (7 phases) compressed from research's 12-phase suggestion per granularity=standard

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Decisions to resolve during phase planning (per research SUMMARY.md):

- Phase 1: APK build flavor `applicationId` choice (`ai.humynlabs.capture.apk` vs `ai.humynlabs.capture`) — locked before flavor structure built
- Phase 1: Embedding provider for `/tasks` semantic search (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` vs local sentence-transformers)
- Phase 1: DPDP / LGPD counsel engagement is an operational track that gates Play Store launch (Phase 7)
- Phase 2: Final Help Center support email (`[EMAIL_ADDRESS]` placeholder); compat-fail "what now" recovery copy needs final wording
- Phase 5: Hash-verify worker placement migration trigger (BullMQ + ECS at MVP → Lambda at 1M-hour scale)
- Phase 6: Published payouts-window date (replaces "Payments coming soon" copy)
- Project-wide: Real-device test-matrix procurement (Pixel 7a / 8a / Helio-class / Snapdragon-7 / Exynos 1280-1380) — current testing-guide six-device matrix is heavy on flagships
